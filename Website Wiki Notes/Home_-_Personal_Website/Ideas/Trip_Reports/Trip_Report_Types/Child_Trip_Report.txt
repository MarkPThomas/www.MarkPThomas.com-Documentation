====== Child Trip Report ======
Created Saturday 02 May 2015

Every trip that is a report is a child trip report of some kind, as at a minimum it has a **geographical parent**.

**Fully** **Automated Trip Reports**
	These are built automatically from database data and provide nothing more than beta file links, GE links, and a photo slideshow if a photo album is present. This form of trip report is the easiest to set up, and it can easily be developed into a Complete Trip Report at a later time.
	
	Generated using album URL & header/footer TR info
	* **Requirements**
		* Title
		* Date
		* Album URL

	Examples include:
	* [[https://sites.google.com/a/markpthomas.com/mark/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/mt-hilgard-pipsqueak-spire?pli=1|Day 1: Mt Hilgard (S Face) & Pipsqueak Spire (Cox Col & Hourglass Couloir)]]

**Partially Automated Trip Reports**
	These are the same as **Fully Automated Trip Reports**, with the exception that a series of photos are shown, each with its photo caption displayed. At the most basic, all photos for the album are displayed, but each photo's table has an indicator for whether or not to suppress the photo. The admin can enter an edit mode (through the GUI, or manually editing the DB) whereby photos can be suppressed from displaying. 
	
	A similar but separate flag exists for the caption so that captions can be shown without photos, or photos without captions.
	* **Requirements**
		* At least 1 populated "photo properties" entry where a photo is not suppressed.

**Complete Trip Reports**
	These reports are set up the same as a **Partially Automated Trip Report**, but in between the photos are paragraphs of text.
	* **Requirements**
		* At least 1 populated text field.

	Examples include:
	* [[http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/south-face-of-charlotte-dome-iii-5-8|South Face of Charlotte Dome (III, 5.8)]]
