====== Trip Report Follow Along Navigator ======
Created Saturday 02 May 2015

The **Trip Report Follow Along Navigator** is a small Google Maps or Leaflet thumbnail map. 
When the user scrolls through photos, the map centers on the location where the photo was taken, with  a small marker indicating the photo spot.
The purpose of the navigator is to allow the user, at a glance, to see where they are in the story along the traveled route.

**Features**
* The navigator can be optionally closed (?)
* The navigator can be optionally sized to be made larger (?)
* If no photos are present for a story, the navigator does not appear.
* If the story is for a rock climb Ideas:Outside Services:LeafLetor big wall climb, the map may be a photo of the face, annotated photo, or drawn topo. This alternative image will be added based on the following considerations:
	* If such an image exists (can be N # of images)
	* Lat/Long of the photos viewed fall within the image bounding box. The bounding box can be a plane with a buffer, or it can be a 4-sized quadrilateral. The bounding box is specified by Lat/Long coordinates that are matched to the image in the database.
	* If the above two features are not met, the default map is used, which is the Google or Leaflet Map.
* If the photo does not have GPS coords, then the last valid photo is displayed until the next valid photo is encountered.

**Items to Decide**
* Should custom Leaflet maps be used?
	* If so, how should it be determined whether [[Home:Ideas:Outside Services:Google Maps|Google Maps]] or [[Home:Ideas:Outside Services:LeafLet|LeafLet]] appear?
	* Should there be 3 cases? Or just 1 of each plane type?
		* (Horizontal Plane) Google Maps
		* (Horizontal Plane) Leaflet
		* (Vertical Plane) Custom image using Leaflet but with no Lat/Long scaling
* How should the navigator scale with BootStrap? 
	* Seems like it should hide with an icon that appears to be clicked on demand.
* Perhaps tracks down a side column that displays header info at top of page?
