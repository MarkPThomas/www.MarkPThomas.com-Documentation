====== Trip Report Footers ======
Created Saturday 02 May 2015

**Internal Site Links**
In the footer, the trip report links are given the following order of prominence:
	* **If access by a Parent Trip Report:**
		* Forward/back for parent list used to access the page (if applicable - include for region parents?).
		* Complete list of children from the list, like a table of contents with the current entry not active as a link. The first entry is the parent report, given a higher header prominence
	* **In all cases:**
		* Forward/back by date within all trip reports on the site

**External Site Links**
These are links to related items on other sites, such as:
	* Picasa Photo Album (consider linking to in-site photo viewer)
	* SuperTopo
