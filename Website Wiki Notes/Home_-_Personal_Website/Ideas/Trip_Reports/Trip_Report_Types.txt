====== Trip Report Types ======
Created Saturday 02 May 2015

In general, there seems to be a number of trip report types. These will be generated based on an enumeration chosen for the following trip report types:
	* [[+Child Trip Report|Child Trip Report]] 
	* [[+Parent Trip Report|Parent Trip Report]] 

Every trip that is a report is a child trip report of some kind, as at a minimum it has a **geographical parent**.
