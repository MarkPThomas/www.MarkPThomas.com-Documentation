====== NavigationFeatures ======
Created Sunday 03 May 2015

Navigation features are different ways by which a user is able to navigate to page content. Depending on the preference of the user, or the area of interest of the user, these different features cater to the user's preferred navigation. They are described below:
	* [[+GeoTree|GeoTree]]
	* [[+Lists|Lists]]
	* [[+RegionsTree|RegionsTree]]

**TBD: A big question is whether to maintain immediate access to a tree view of either the GeoTree or RegionsTree. This could be a menu that sweeps in from the side, and can flip from one to the other based on a radio button selection.)**

These features are used to access the following separate categories of pages:
	* [[Home - Personal Website:Ideas:Trip Reports|Trip Reports]]
	* Guidebooks
	* Personal Notes & Planning
