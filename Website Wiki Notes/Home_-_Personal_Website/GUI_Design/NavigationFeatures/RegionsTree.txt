====== RegionsTree ======
Created Sunday 03 May 2015

The [[RegionsTree]] is an expandable list based on the regions hierarchies of the peak/feature or route of interest. Each level of the tree can itself can be a hyperlink to a page about that tree level.

Regions are a combination of political boundaries and arbitraty choices of existing or personal classifications. These are similar to the GeoTree, but are looser in organization, shallower in hierarchy, and in some cases grouped by type/concept.

The trees are dynamically generated from Database Tables, and update accordingly. Links to the final child pages of interest have to do with the method by which the tree is entered (Trip Report, Guidebook, etc), and what the child element as listed as its most immediate parent.

This page also includes a navigable map using [[Home - Personal Website:Ideas:Outside Services:LeafLet|Leaflet]]. The individual regions are separate layers that can be selectively turned on/off. All child elements are shown, and depending on the level of zoom, the different regions are highlighted & various ways (outlines, overlays, etc.). Zooming in to certain regions may cause the background to change to a custom map for the area.
