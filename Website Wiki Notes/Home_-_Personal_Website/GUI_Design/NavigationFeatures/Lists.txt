====== Lists ======
Created Sunday 03 May 2015

Lists are the popular lists outside of the website that people might be using to select and prioritize climbs. The lists page shows all of the included lists. The user can click these to enter the [[Home - Personal Website:Ideas:Trip Reports:Trip Report Types:Parent Trip Report|Lists Parents]] page, where the individual reports are accessed.

This page also includes a navigable map using [[Home - Personal Website:Ideas:Outside Services:LeafLet|Leaflet]]. The individual lists are separate layers that can be selectively turned on/off, each of which show all of the child elements. Some of the lists have their own sub-region designations, and depending on the level of zoom, the different regions are highlighted & various ways (outlines, overlays, etc.). Zooming in to certain regions may cause the background to change to a custom map for the area.
