				* Keyword/tag
				* User-typed query
				* Topics (e.g. cross-referenced with lists)

	* **Casual Browsers**
		* Photography

**Overall Flow**
Standard Navigating Scheme (listed in full first, then shorthand)
Only in sidebar (for slightly expanded shortcutting) 
Lists contain direct links to pages within each list section.
Regions & GeoTree have pages nested in a hierarchy (where created) ending in the page.

**Lists :** Popular lists, personal lists. 

**Regions:** are at arbitrary levels of and contain arbitrary collections of geographic hierarchies

**GeoTree:** Full mechanical breakdown to location at all levels in a tree (such as in peakbagger.com)
